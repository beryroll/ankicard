# Missing traditional flashcards?
Hey there. Are you also a fan of keeping things traditional, and a fan of CSS like me? This mini-mini-project was designed to deliver your wish, and in less time! Enjoy studying with authentic flashcards, including handwriting font-families and card shadows.

This git contains two files: `cardsetup.html` and `cardstyle.css`. `cardsetup.html` was quite a useless file, but it was just to show you how to structure things if you're a beginner. Feel free to tinker around with the `cardstyle.css` file!

# About me
I really liked the concept of paper flashcards, but honestly, anything physically (compared to digitally) is always a lot to handle. You always have to remember where you kept things, and you have to ensure it doesn't get damaged, and also a find a way to bundle them all into a deck!

Since that dilemma, I found Anki, a free solution with so much flexibility! I had to jump at the chance.
However, I do really like skeuomorphic design (something close to it) and I wanted to replicate the design we usually find on paper cards.

#Too much blabber
Ok bye.
